```

**Or Django Shell:**

user = User.objects.get(email='your@email.com')
user.is_staff = True
user.is_active = True
user.save()
```

- [ ] `/custom-admin/trips/ongoing/` resolves correctly
- [ ] `/custom-admin/trips/completed/` resolves correctly

**Test Command:**
```bash
python test_admin.py
```

**Expected Output:**
```
✅ admin_dashboard                -> /custom-admin/

## 🔒 Security Tests

### Authentication
- [ ] Non-logged-in users are redirected to login
- [ ] Non-staff users get 403 Forbidden
- [ ] Staff users can access all admin pages

**Test Manually:**
1. Logout if logged in
2. Try accessing `/custom-admin/`
3. Should redirect to login page

### Authorization
- [ ] Regular users (is_staff=False) cannot access admin
- [ ] Staff users can access all features
- [ ] Admins cannot deactivate themselves

**Test Cases:**
```python
# Create test users
User.objects.create_user('regular@test.com', password='test')  # is_staff=False
User.objects.create_user('admin@test.com', password='test')     # Set is_staff=True
```

### CSRF Protection
- [ ] All forms have CSRF token
- [ ] POST requests without token are rejected

**Visual Check:**
- Open any admin page
- Right-click → "View Page Source"
- Search for: `csrfmiddlewaretoken`
