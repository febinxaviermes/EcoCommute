## Best Practices

### For Administrators
1. **User Management:**
   - Deactivate suspicious accounts instead of deleting
   - Verify Aadhaar status before handling disputes
   - Contact users via phone before deactivation

2. **Ride Management:**
   - Monitor ongoing trips regularly
   - Only cancel rides when absolutely necessary
   - Check both confirmations before intervening

3. **Security:**
   - Don't share staff credentials
   - Use strong passwords
   - Log out after each session
   - Regularly review user activity

4. **Data Integrity:**
   - Avoid unnecessary cancellations
   - Let rides complete naturally
   - Only intervene in case of reports

## Troubleshooting

### Cannot Access Admin Dashboard
- Check if user has `is_staff=True`
- Verify user is logged in
- Clear browser cache
- Check URL is `/custom-admin/` not `/admin/`

### Permission Denied
- Ensure user account is active (`is_active=True`)
- Verify staff status in database
- Try logging out and back in

### Changes Not Saving
- Check for JavaScript errors in console
- Verify CSRF token is present
- Check server logs for errors
- Ensure database is not read-only
